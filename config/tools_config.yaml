# Tool Security Gateway — Parametric Whitelist Configuration
# Each entry defines a whitelisted command template with regex-validated parameters.
# Commands use Windows CLI (cmd.exe / PowerShell) syntax.
#
# DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Only expose tools for I/O operations (read/write/run).
# Text analysis tasks (searching, extracting, counting, summarizing) are handled
# by the LLM's native reasoning — NOT by CLI tools. This prevents the agent from
# drifting into tool-chaining for tasks it should solve with text comprehension.

  # --- REMOVED CLI WRITE TOOLS (replaced by Python scripts) ---
  # write_json, write_txt, write_md have been moved to Python scripts in
  # scripts/ directory (write_json.py, write_txt.py, write_md.py).
  # All file writing must now go through safe_py_runner for safer execution.

# --- REMOVED CLI TOOLS (replaced by LLM native reasoning) ---
# The following tools were removed because they overlap with the LLM's text
# processing capabilities and encourage tool-chaining instead of reasoning:
#
# - search_text (findstr): LLM should read the full file and search within context
# - head_file (Get-Content -TotalCount): LLM should read_file and process the beginning
# - tail_file (Get-Content -Tail): LLM should read_file and process the end
# - word_count (Measure-Object): LLM should read_file and count/estimate in reasoning

# Blocked patterns — commands that must NEVER be executed
